# The whole world missed the real Millennium!

I read a book called *Horrible Science - The Terrible Truth About Time* and a part of page 52 said:

> Er - hold on! I've just thought of something! That means history teachers and history books have been wrong about dates for over 2000 years! Even the dates in the books were wrong! It means that the real Millennium celebrations should have been celebrated in 1996 and the WHOLE WORLD missed the big day! OOPS!

That means we should celebrate the *next* Millennium at 1,001,996 CE! Not the *first one* at 1,000,000 CE! And that means not the *next one* at 2,000,000 CE!

And that means we got an advance for the Millennium by 998,004 years and that means we'll be celebrating the Millennium + 998,004 years! That's close to the next Millennium!

If you don't have a calculator handy, I could show you the math.
```
Math:

1,000,000 The wrong time the Millennium should be celebrated
-   1,996 The right time the Millennium should be celebrated
_________
  998,004 The years late the Millennium has been planned
  
Math check:
  111 11
  998,004
+   1,996
_________
1,000,000
